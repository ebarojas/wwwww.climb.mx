# AGENTIC INSTRUCTION.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code, Cursor or other agentic tools.

## Project Overview

Use README.md as a reference - it is complete and very well written.

The blog content is mostly philosophy, literature, and personal writing—essays, book reviews, reflections on endurance cycling, woodworking, and other pursuits.

Always adhere to current standards, document simply but thoroughly and always look for the most minimal implementation.
